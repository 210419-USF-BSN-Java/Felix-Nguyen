## Getting Started
#### Cloning a repository into your local storage
   1. Open ***Git Bash*** - if Git is not already installed, you can visit the link [here] (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the corresponding version for your operating system
   2. Go to the current directory where you want the cloned directory to be added
   3. Right click inside the folder and select ***Git Bash Here***

   ![here](./p1-images/GitBash-Folder.jpg)

   4. Copy one of the following links
   - For HTTPS:
      -  https://github.com/210419-USF-BSN-Java/Felix-Nguyen.git
   - For SSH:		
   		- git@github.com:210419-USF-BSN-Java/Felix-Nguyen.git
   - For GitHub CLI 
      -  gh repo clone 210419-USF-BSN-Java/Felix-Nguyen

   
   5. Inside Git Bash, enter ***git clone*** plus your link and hit enter.  The repository will then be visible within your local folder.
  
      ![here](./p1-images/GitBash-Command.jpg)  

   6. Open Eclipse or Spring Tool Suite 
   7. Select File - > Import - > Maven - > Existing Maven Projects.  
Select the project name you want to import, in this case project1.

8. In order for the project to run, it needs to be hosted an application server.  For my project I used Tomcat v8.5.

   Visit here to download Tomcat 8.5: https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi

   Under Core, install the zip file.

    ![here](./p1-images/Tomcat-download.jpg)  


   9. To add a server into STS or Eclipse, select File - > New - > Other - > Server - > Tomcat v8.5 Server
   
    ![here](./p1-images/Tomcat-version.jpg)  

      - Server host name: localhost
      - Server name: Tomcat v8.5 Server at localhost
      - Server runtime environment: Apache Tomcat v8.5.  

      Finish.

   10. Add the project to the server
      
       - Right click on the server - > Add and Remove - > select project1 - > Add - > Finish

## Usage

> Here, you instruct other people on how to use your project after theyï¿½ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

Start up the application server (Tomcat) here

![here](./p1-images/Tomcat-start.jpg)

The console will start displaying start up data.

>Go into your browser and enter http://localhost:8080/project1/

This is the main login page for both employees and managers.

If setup is successful, the user will be introduced to this page

![here](./p1-images/Login.jpg)

The credentials for an employee are
>Username: felix

>Password: nguyen

Upon logging in the employee will be directed to the home page.

![here](./p1-images/Emp-Home.jpg)

The employee may select ***View Your Tickets*** to check any pending or reviewed requests updated by a manager.  Currently this employee has one ticket that was rejected.

![here](./p1-images/View-ticket1.jpg)

We can submit a ticket through ***Submit a ticket*** 

![here](./p1-images/Submit.jpg)

After sending a ticket, we can view our recently created ticket by checking ***View Your Tickets*** again.

![here](./p1-images/View-ticket2.jpg)

Additionally an employee may view their info through ***View Info***

![here](./p1-images/View-Info.jpg)

Or update their information by clicking ***Update Info***

![here](./p1-images/Update-Info.jpg)

Selecting ***Log Out*** will return the employee back to the login page.

To log in as a manager use the following credentials:
>Username: ldadd3

>Password: NrSLHxr0VDQ


On successful login, the manager will be directed to the manager home page.

![here](./p1-images/manager-home.jpg)

We can review employee requests by clicking on ***Accept/Reject Requests***. We can also see that our recent ticket was just added at the bottom.

![here](./p1-images/ar-1.jpg)

To approve or reject the request, enter a reimbursement ID on the first column and choose from the drop down.  Click on submit to finalize.  Clicking on reset allows to view the changes.

![here](./p1-images/ar-2.jpg)

![here](./p1-images/ar-3.jpg)

Additionally we can filter employee requests by ***ID*** by entering in form and clicking submit.
![here](./p1-images/ar-4.jpg)

Furthermore we can filter employee requests by ***status*** such as submitted, approved, and rejected.
![here](./p1-images/ar-5.jpg)

Lastly, a manager can view all employees which also includes all managers.
